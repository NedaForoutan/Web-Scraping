# Web-Scriping
This repository contains two Python scripts for web scraping, ranging from a simple to a more advanced web scraping task. It also includes an example output file generated by the advanced web scraping script.

## Contents

1. **Simple-Web_Scraping.py** - A basic web scraper that extracts headings, paragraphs, and links from any webpage.
2. **Advanced_Web_Scraping.py** - An advanced web scraper specifically designed to scrape product information from the Sportswear website's women's trainers section (the name of the website is anonymized).
3. **sportswear_women_trainers.csv** - An example output file generated by the Advanced_Web_Scraping python script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

# Usage

# Example Output
The repository includes an example output file, `sportswear_women_trainers.csv`, which contains product information scraped from the Sportswear website.

# Anonymization Notice
This Advanced_Web_Scraping script has been debranded to protect the identity of the specific website it was originally designed for. All identifying information, such as the domain name and specific brand references, have been anonymized.

# Notes
Web scraping can be against the terms of service of some websites. Always check the website's robots.txt file and terms of service before scraping. Make sure you have permission to scrape the data you are accessing.
Avoid overloading the server. The advanced script includes random delays between requests to avoid being blocked by the website. Consider using proxies and rotating user-agents for large-scale scraping.
